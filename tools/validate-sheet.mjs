/**
 * LOOP-003 §3 — the sheet validator. Nothing goes to the writer without it.
 *
 * The loop's whole claim is that each failed attempt makes the next one easier
 * rather than merely better informed, and that claim rests entirely on the
 * sheet being complete every time. A sheet missing its scores, or a finding
 * missing its quote, does not degrade the redraft a little — it returns the
 * writer to guessing, which is the state attempt 1 was already in.
 *
 * So this is a gate on the instrument, not a lint. §8.3 forbids sending a sheet
 * that does not pass, and forbids trimming findings to make one shorter.
 *
 *   node validate-sheet.mjs <file.md> [--attempt 3]
 *   node validate-sheet.mjs --self-test
 *
 * Exit 0 when the sheet may be sent, 1 when it may not, and the reasons are
 * printed either way.

  The lowest is 7. All six must reach 8.

DO NOT TOUCH — these passed, and changing them can only cost you:
  Science · Outline · Length · Heading · Prose

OPEN — Continuity (1 finding, worst first)
  1. [medium] Timeline arithmetic
     Quote:        "Drafted 0118 ship time, nine hours out, received 1912."
     What is wrong: 0118 to 1912 is eighteen hours, not nine.
     Against what:  bible/timeline.md, Day 2 — the offer arrives eighteen hours stale.
     How it should read: flight time plus time queued at the relay must total eighteen.

RESOLVED since the last attempt:
  (none — this is the first correction)

RULE: change only the lines quoted above.
