/**
 * LOOP-003 §6 — the instrument.
 *
 * Reads a run's critiques and log and reports, per chapter: the five scores at
 * each attempt, which attempt it passed on, which findings were resolved,
 * carried, newly raised or raised late, how many lines the writer touched
 * against how many the sheet cited, and what the attempt cost.
 *
 * **The writer never measures itself and neither do the critics.** That is the
 * whole reason this file exists rather than a paragraph in SKILL.md asking the
 * orchestrator to keep count. A model asked whether it improved will say yes.
 *
 * Two commands:
 *
 *   node measure.mjs <slug>        report on one run
 *   node measure.mjs --self-test   §6.2, against the committed run
 *
 * §6.2 fixes what the self-test must reproduce, and it is deliberately a run
 * that already exists: an instrument that cannot recover a known history is an
 * instrument, not a measurement.
